## ⚠️ Note

* This project uses JavaScript’s `eval()` function for calculations.
  It works fine for learning purposes, but **is not recommended for production apps** due to security concerns.

## 🌱 Future Improvements (Optional)

* Add keyboard support
* Improve error handling (e.g., divide by zero)
* Replace `eval()` with a safer calculation logic
* Add dark mode
